1. **Game Map / Flowchart**

	- *Insert your flowchart or room map here as an image:*

		I do not need to put the image here as it is on google classroom.

	- *Rooms:* 
	Ancient Greece, Ancient China, Ancient Rome, and a Final Battle.

	- *Decision Points:*

		Main menu – start, instructions, or quit

		Weapon management – add, remove, or continue

		Battle – choose weapon, choose special attack

		Enemy counter – damage changes depending on enemy

		Extras – villager trading, restart after death 

	- *Puzzle Areas:* 

		Riddle challenge – at the start of a civilisation (tests knowledge/problem-solving).

		Villager trading puzzle – decide whether to trade or not, affects inventory.

		Battle system – challenge of choosing correct weapon/attack to defeat enemy.

		Resource management – ration use (lose or preserve items depending on choice).
		
2. Reflection (200+ Words)
In this section, explain your:
- Design process – How did your game idea evolve?
 - Coding challenges – What bugs or logic issues did you solve?
 - Features you're proud of – Which part of your code or design stands out?
 - Learning experience – What Python skills or techniques did you develop?
Example

I started with a basic idea of a haunted house, but expanded it into multiple endings and an inventory puzzle. I struggled with tracking multiple items in a list but learned how to use `in`, `append()`, and `remove()`. The final code lets players explore, collect tools, and escape through different strategies.
3. AI Usage Declaration
Be well aware that CODE from AI follows easily recognisable traits and structures (to us and out defensive robots). If your classwork doesn’t line up with your asessment then it will be flagged and we will ask you to defend your work. You don’t need AI to complete this task! We strongly suggest you do the work yourself as a beginner.  Read the assessment carefully. Any suspicious behaviour result in further discussion and potential malpractice. And yes, people are picked up and do get zero. It is your responsibility to meet the assessment criteria.
Declaration:

 I used ChatGPT in Week X to help with [brief reason]. I adapted the suggestion by [what you changed], and the final version reflects my own logic and storytelling. I have commented the relevant part in my `.py` file.
4. Helper Function Use
Tick the helper functions you used and explain how:
☑ cls() – Clears the screen between rooms
 	*Used to create smooth transitions between rooms.*
☑ animate() – Typewriter effect
 	*Used for opening narration and when describing puzzles.*
☑ coloured() – Highlight text for clues or danger
 	*Used to draw attention to hazards or inventory alerts.*
